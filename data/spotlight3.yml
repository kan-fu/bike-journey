  While searching for new destinations, I discovered the Grand Illinois Trailâ€”a 535-mile loop in northern Illinois, 
  more than half of it on limestone paths. I took on the challenge in the winter of 2016. 
  Ambitious as I was, the attempt proved too difficult at the time: 
  I was unprepared and faced harsh conditions with subzero temperatures and short daylight hours. 
  I managed to complete only a third of the trail. The following spring, I took the lessons to heart 
  and opted for a gentler loop closer to the city. Together, those two rides remain among my fondest memories in the U.S.
