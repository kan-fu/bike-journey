  Champaign is where I pursued my graduate studies, 
  and it was also where I first began to appreciate the beauty of nature. 
  I set myself the goal of traversing every park and main trail in town. 
  As I gained more experience, I ventured further, biking to neighboring towns and further parks.
  I tracked each trip with a phone app and later combined all the GPX files into a single Google Earth map using Python. 
  Seeing the web of routes I had covered light up on the map felt like a true accomplishment.
