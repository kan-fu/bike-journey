title : "Kan's Cycling Adventure"
content : |
  I've loved bikes since junior high, when I first started commuting on two wheels. <br /> <br />
  Over time, I realized that biking is the perfect pace for exploring a cityâ€”not as slow as walking, 
  not as rushed as driving. <br /> <br />
  So I made myself a promise: to ride every bike trail marked on Google Maps in my neighborhood. <br /> <br />
  Until now, I'm proud to say, I'm still keeping that promise.
