  Kaizhou is my hometown, a small town surrounded by mountains. 
  As a child, climbing them was part of my weekly routine. 
  Yet I didn’t truly begin exploring my hometown until 2021, when I suddenly had plenty of free time 
  before going abroad. The steep mountains—some reaching up to 800 meters—were a real challenge for me, 
  But the harder the climb, the greater the thrill of the ride downhill.
  Kaizhou is a small town, and I love my hometown.
