title : "Shanghai, China"
content: |
  After graduation, I spent four years working in Shanghai, 
  commuting to work by bike every weekday. 
  On weekends, cycling became my way to relax and enjoy some fresh air. Among my favorite rides were 
  the Pudong riverside trail and the 200-km Chongming Island Loop. 
  I also loved exploring Songjiang District, a wonderful travel destination well within biking distance.
