  I am currently working in Victoria, a true cyclist’s paradise. 
  Victoria has an extensive network of bike lanes and scenic trails, 
  with the Galloping Goose and Lochside trails standing out as my favorites. 
  Beyond the city paths, the surrounding landscape is breathtaking—mountains, forests, beaches, lakes, 
  and the vast Pacific Ocean are all within reach by bike. Every ride feels like a blend of adventure and serenity, 
  and I honestly could not ask for more.
